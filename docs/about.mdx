# Lego Island Decompilation

<h3>
  This is a work-in-progress decompilation of LEGO Island version 1.1
</h3>


## What is this?

This is a work-in-progress decompilation of LEGO Island version 1.1.
It aims to be relatively faithful, but not byte accurate. The goal is to provide a workable codebase that can be modified, improved, and ported to other platforms later on.

## Status

Currently ISLE.EXE is completely decompiled, however there are some known inaccuracies. It should work if you pair it with the original game's LEGO1.DLL (and other files), however small things may not work correctly yet. Work on decompiling LEGO1.DLL has only just started and currently it is too incomplete to be usable.

## Additional information

### Which version of LEGO Island do I have?
> Right click on LEGO1.DLL, select Properties, and switch to the Details tab. Under Version you should either see 1.0.0.0 (1.0) or 1.1.0.0 (1.1). Additionally, you can look at the game disc files; 1.0's files will all say August 8, 1997, and 1.1's files will all say September 8, 1997. Version 1.1 is by far the most common, especially if you're not using the English or Japanese versions, so that's most likely the version you have.

### SmartHeap
> Both ISLE.EXE and LEGO1.DLL were originally statically linked with SmartHeap, a drop-in replacement for malloc/free that presumably provides better heap memory management on the old low-memory (16MB) systems this game was designed for. Unfortunately, acquiring SmartHeap legally is expensive, and the chances of acquiring the exact same version used by Mindscape in the late 90s is very low. Since it's a drop-in binary-compatible replacement, this decomp can just stick with the standard malloc/free functions while still achieving matching assembly on a per-function level, however the resulting binaries will never be byte accurate as a result of this. If you notice significant size disparities, particularly in ISLE.EXE, the lack of statically linked SmartHeap libraries is why.
